ABSTRACT
    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync is a POE component that alerts
    newly uploaded CPAN distributions. It obtains this information by
    running rsync against a CPAN mirror. This effectively keeps your local
    CPAN mirror up-to-date too!

DESCRIPTION
    Really, all you have to do is load the module and call it's spawn()
    method:

            use POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync;
            POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync->spawn( ... );

    This method will return failure on errors or return success. Normally
    you just need to set the rsync server. ( rsync_src )

  spawn()
    This constructor accepts either a hashref or a hash, valid options are:

   alias
    This sets the alias of the session.

    The default is: SmokeBox-Rsync

   rsync_src
    This sets the rsync source ( the server you will be mirroring from ) and
    it is a mandatory parameter. For a list of valid rsync mirrors, please
    consult the <http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html#RSYNC> mirror list.

    The default is: undefined

   rsync_dst
    This sets the local rsync destination ( where your local CPAN mirror
    resides )

    The default is: $ENV{HOME}/CPAN

   rsync
    This sets the rsync options. Normally you do not need to touch this, but
    if you do - please be aware that your options clobbers the default
    values! Please look at the File::Rsync manpage for the options. Again,
    touch this if you know what you are doing!

    The default is:

            {
                    archive=>1,
                    compress=>1,
                    omit-dir-times=>1,
                    itemize-changes=>1,
                    exclude=[ /indices/, /misc/, /src/, /scripts/, /modules/.FRMRecent-*, /authors/.FRMRecent-* ],
                    literal=[ --no-motd ]
            }

    NOTE: By default we only mirror the /authors/ and /modules/
    subdirectories of CPAN. If you want to keep your mirror up-to-date with
    regards to the other paths, please use your normal ( crontabbed? ) rsync
    script and tell it to exclude authors+modules to prevent missed dists.

    NOTE: The usage of "omit-dir-times/itemize-changes" means you need a
    rsync newer than v2.6.4!

   interval
    This sets the seconds between rsync mirror executions. Please don't set
    it to a low value unless you have permission from the mirror admin!

    The default is: 3600

   event
    This sets the event which will receive notification about uploaded
    dists. It will receive one argument in ARG0, which is a single string.
    An example is:

            V/VP/VPIT/CPANPLUS-Dist-Gentoo-0.07.tar.gz

    The default is: upload

   session
    This sets the session which will receive the notification event. You can
    either use a POE session id, alias, or reference. You can just spawn the
    component inside another session and it will automatically receive the
    notifications.

    The default is: undef ( caller session )

   rsyncdone
    This sets an additional event when the rsync process is done executing.
    It will receive a hashref in ARG0 which details some information. An
    example is:

            {
                    'status'        => 1,           # boolean value whether the rsync run was successful or not
                    'exit'          => 0,           # exit code of the rsync process, useful to look up rsync errors ( already bit-shifted! )
                    'starttime'     => 1260432932,  # self-explanatory
                    'stoptime'      => 1260432965,  # self-explanatory
                    'dists'         => 7,           # number of new distributions uploaded to CPAN
            }

    NOTE: In my testing sometimes rsync throws an exit code of 23 ( Partial
    transfer due to error ) or 24 ( Partial transfer due to vanished source
    files ), this module automatically treats them as "success" and sets the
    exit code to 0. This is caused by the intricacies of rsync trying to
    mirror some forbidden files and deletions on the host. Hence, the
    ".FRMRecent" stuff you see in the exclude list - this is one of the
    common error 23 causes :)

    The default is: undef ( not enabled )

  Commands
    There is only one command you can use, as this is a very simple module.

   shutdown()
    Tells this module to shut down the underlying rsync session and
    terminate itself.

            $_[KERNEL]->post( 'SmokeBox-Rsync', 'shutdown' );

  More Ideas
    None as of now, if you have ideas please submit them to me!

    You can enable debugging mode by doing this:

            sub POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync::DEBUG () { 1 }
            use POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync;
