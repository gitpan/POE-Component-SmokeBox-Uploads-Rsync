DESCRIPTION

    POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync is a POE component that alerts
    newly uploaded CPAN distributions. It obtains this information by
    running rsync against a CPAN mirror. This is only for the
    CPAN/authors/id directory, to make it easier on the rsync process. If
    you want to keep your entire mirror up-to-date, you can enable the
    "rsync_all" option.

    Really, all you have to do is load the module and call it's spawn()
    method:

            use POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync;
            POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync->spawn( ... );

    This method will return failure on errors or return success. Normally
    you just need to set the rsync server. ( rsync_src )

 spawn()

    This constructor accepts either a hashref or a hash, valid options are:

  alias

    This sets the alias of the session.

    The default is: SmokeBox-Rsync

  rsync_src

    This sets the rsync source ( the server you will be mirroring from )
    and it is a mandatory parameter. For a list of valid rsync mirrors,
    please consult the http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html mirror list.

    An example is: mirrors.kernel.org::mirrors/CPAN/

    The default is: undefined

  rsync_dst

    This sets the local rsync destination ( where your local CPAN mirror
    resides )

    The default is: $ENV{HOME}/CPAN

  rsync_all

    If this is a true value, this module will rsync the entire CPAN. Useful
    for lazy people who don't want to run a separate rsync process for the
    rest of CPAN. If it is false, this module will rsync only the
    authors/id directory to make the rsync run faster.

    Additionally, if this is true the option --delete will be passed to the
    rsync process. This keeps your local copy exactly the same as it is on
    CPAN. If you want to override this just pass a delete=0 option to the
    "rsync" hash.

    The default is: false

  rsync

    This sets the rsync options. Normally you do not need to touch this,
    but if you do - please be aware that your options clobbers the default
    values! Please look at the File::Rsync manpage for the options. Again,
    touch this if you know what you are doing!

    The default is:

            {
                    archive         => 1,
                    compress        => 1,
                    omit-dir-times  => 1,
                    itemize-changes => 1,
                    timeout         => 10 * 60,     # 10min
                    contimeout      => 2 * 60,      # 2min
                    literal         => [ qw( --no-motd ) ],
            }

    NOTE: The usage of "omit-dir-times/itemize-changes/contimeout" means
    you need a rsync newer than v3.0.0!

  interval

    This sets the seconds between rsync mirror executions. Please don't set
    it to a low value unless you have permission from the mirror admin!

    The default is: 3600 ( 1 hour )

  event

    This sets the event which will receive notification about uploaded
    dists. It will receive one argument in ARG0, which is a single string.
    An example is:

            V/VP/VPIT/CPANPLUS-Dist-Gentoo-0.07.tar.gz

    The default is: upload

  session

    This sets the session which will receive the notification event. You
    can either use a POE session id, alias, or reference. You can just
    spawn the component inside another session and it will automatically
    receive the notifications.

    The default is: undef ( caller session )

  rsyncdone

    This sets an additional event when the rsync process is done executing.
    It will receive a hashref in ARG0 which details some information. An
    example is:

            {
                    'status'        => 1,           # boolean value whether the rsync run was successful or not
                    'exit'          => 0,           # exit code of the rsync process, useful to look up rsync errors ( already bit-shifted! )
                    'exit_str'      => 'Success',   # stringified exit code of the rsync process
                    'starttime'     => 1260432932,  # self-explanatory
                    'stoptime'      => 1260432965,  # self-explanatory
                    'dists'         => 7,           # number of new distributions uploaded to CPAN
            }

    NOTE: In my testing sometimes rsync throws an exit code of 23 ( Partial
    transfer due to error ) or 24 ( Partial transfer due to vanished source
    files ), this module automatically treats them as "success" and sets
    the exit code to 0. This is caused by the intricacies of rsync trying
    to mirror some forbidden files and deletions on the host. See
    https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3653 for more info.

    The default is: undef ( not enabled )

 Commands

    There is only one command you can use, as this is a very simple module.

  shutdown

    Tells this module to shut down the underlying rsync session and
    terminate itself.

            $_[KERNEL]->post( 'SmokeBox-Rsync', 'shutdown' );

 Module Notes

    You can enable debugging mode by doing this:

            sub POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync::DEBUG () { 1 }
            use POE::Component::SmokeBox::Uploads::Rsync;
